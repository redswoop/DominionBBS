# Dominion BBS Archive

Dominion BBS was my attempt at a "What if Telegard was a fork of WWIV 4.0 instead of WWIV 3.0?"

I worked on it with the zeal of a teenager for years, learning how to code in C.

This is an archive of what I can reconstruct as of June 2024.

## Running the BBS

You can run the BBS in DosBox Staging v0.8x.  

Add the following to your dropbox.conf to enable remote login via telnet.

```
serial1=modem telnet:1 listenport:3333
```
