                         THE BNUPORT UTILITY


    BNUPORT allows changing  port  assignments  used  by  the BNU
    communications driver.  It directly  reads  and  patches  the
    existing driver file "BNU.COM" or "BNU.SYS" to  use  specific
    interrupt and/or IO  port  base  addresses  for up to 16 port
    configurations.

    Usage:

         BNUPORT [/H] [/C] [/M] [/P [patchfile]]

              /H   Displays help
              /C   Forces colour screen pallette
              /M   Forces monochrome screen pallette
              /S   Search for and patch BNU.SYS
              /P   Use previously generated patchfile


    BNUPORT searchs first  the  current   directory,   then   all
    directories in the  PATH for BNU.COM (or BNU.SYS  if  the  /S
    argument is given)  and  uses  the  first  one  located.   It
    presents a form which may be  used  to  change  communcations
    parameters.

    It is advisable  NOT to change these values unless  you  know
    precisely what you're  doing.  You may find a hardware manual
    supplied with a  serial  adaptor   useful   in  locating  the
    required values.

    It is possible to generate a "patchfile" to keep  a permanant
    record of your system's communications port parameters.  Once
    set up, press  F9  to  save into the driver and also generate
    BNUPORT.PAT.  This patch file  may  be used to "import" these
    settings on upgrading to a new version of BNU  by  specifying
    the "/P" switch on the command line (and optionally the patch
    file name if you renamed it).
