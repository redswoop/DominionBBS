   In the interests of conserving file size (and expense) BNU is no longer
   distributed with the  Revision 5 FOSSIL specification.    This document
   can be found on any networking system carrying  the FTSC documentation,
   and is called FSC-0015.*   Developers should refer to that when writing
   an interface using FOSSIL extended communications calls.

   For information on BNU specific enhancements to these calls designed to
   suit special-purpose situations, you are welcome to contact me.
