                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver
                                                     Version 1.70



    BNU is a  FOSSIL  compatible  Communications driver, suitable
    for use with the following (among  others) bulletin board and
    FidoNet(tm) mailer software:


     Fido v11,12  Tom Jennings, Fido Software
     BinkleyTerm  Vince Perriello, Bob Hartman, Alan Applegate,
                  & Bit Bucket Software
     Opus-CBCS    Wynn Wagner III, The POLE of Dallas
     QuickBBS     Adam Hudson
     TPBoard      John Schnieder & Rick Peterson
     SEAdog       Thom  Henderson, System Enhancement Associates
     D'Bridge     Chris Irwin

    It handles hardware  specific  aspects  of communications, to
    enable the above applications to run in multiple environments
    which are supported by a FOSSIL  compatible  driver.   BNU is
    designed for the IBM PC, XT, AT, AT/386 and PS/2  range under
    the MS-DOS operating  system  version 2.10 and above, OS/2 in
    'DOS compatibility' mode and under  PC-MOS/386.   It may also
    be compatible with other environments which emulate MS-DOS.

    The term 'FOSSIL'  is  short  for "Fido Opus SEAdog  Standard
    Interface Layer".  It  is  a  generic hardware interface used
    mainly by bulletin board systems  and Fidonet compatible mail
    software which evolved from the efforts of Wynn  Wagner,  Bob
    Hartman and Vince   Perriello.    The  current  "Revision  5"
    standard makes it possible for  a lot of software to run on a
    wide variety of hardware platforms capable of  running MS-DOS
    but with distinct and incompatible hardware.

    BNU's main task  is  communications  handling.  It is a fully
    interrupt driven communications   driver   which  effectively
    handles communications "in  background",  and   continues  to
    receive and transmit   characters   asynchronously  with  any
    program or application running.   The application itself need
    not be concerned   about   the  time  critical   aspects   of
    communications, nor the capabilities, limitations or features
    of the hardware itself.  These are all handled by BNU itself.

    BNU is one  of many FOSSIL drivers available.  BNU implements
    many features found in other(tm) FOSSIL drivers, sometimes in
    a slightly different  way.    Known   differences   will   be
    highlighted.

    This package contains BNU.COM, with the driver itself being a
    TSR program (Terminate and Stay Resident) which may be loaded
    and unloaded, activated  or  made  dormant "on-the-fly";  and
    also BNU.SYS, a  device  driver  implementation  loaded  from
    CONFIG.SYS.  This is not as 'flexible'  as using BNU.COM, but
    in general conserves some memory and allows loading  in  some
    environments where the TSR implementation cannot be used.

                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver
                                                     Version 1.70

    Some of BNU's unique and more interesting features are:

         o    BNU  has  been  built  to  handle up to 4 COM ports
              concurrently in up to 16 different configurations,

         o    It has an "open architecture"  which  will allow is
              adaptation later  in  its  development  to  support
              multiport shared    interrupt    and    intelligent
              asynchronous IO boards,

         o    It supports the 16550 USART in fully buffered mode,
              providing the capability of much higher baud rates,
              performance and  significantly  less  CPU  overhead
              especially in multitasking environments,

         o    The driver is extremely FAST, optimised  for speed,
              and takes up very little memory,

         o    Incorporates  an optional "diagnostic" mode, so you
              (the user) can inspect  the  state  of  the  FOSSIL
              driver itself;    assisting   in   debugging    and
              optimisation of   software  being  written  to  use
              FOSSIL calls,  and   in   attempting  to  determine
              problems in  software  using a FOSSIL,  such  as  a
              mailer, BBS or BBS 'door',

         o    Has  'hooks'  for  an installable driver to support
              network and  multitasking  software,  forcing  ill-
              behaved processor intensive programs  to  give more
              of their  time-slice to the system when inactive or
              when simply "polling"  communications  or  keyboard
              functions for activity or status reports,

         o    Allows 'fast' routing of screen output directly via
              the ANSI  driver,  making  "FOSSIL"  screen  output
              calls significantly   faster  than  going  via  DOS
              itself,

         o    Allows for problems  in  some  XT  &  AT BIOS' when
              16550AN's are installed:  very often  a  BIOS  will
              not 'see'  the  communications  chip during startup
              diagnostics -  so   BNU  will  force  the  BIOS  to
              recognise it automatically,

         o    Provides a full range of utility functions  in  the
              same .COM  file,  including built-in carrier watch,
              system reboot, lock baud rate and/or communications
              parameters and allowing  some  PC  BIOS  compatible
              non-FOSSIL aware  software to take advantage  of  a
              interrupt driven communications,

         o    Allows   resizing  of  communications  buffers  and
              locking/unlocking   of   baud   rates   and   other
              communications parameters "on-the-fly",

         o    Provides a means of displaying the currently loaded
              driver's "status" and active parameters.

                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver
                                                     Version 1.70

    BNU.COM is both a FOSSIL driver (TSR) and a utility which can
    manipulate the resident   version   of   itself.    On  first
    successful loading, it will terminate  and  leave  the driver
    portion of itself   (only   about  5K  or  so   plus   buffer
    requirements) resident, and  allocate  communication  buffers
    for each of the enabled ports (typically  using 14K for a one
    port install when  'diagnostics' mode is enabled).   It  then
    captures and utilises  the  system's  INT 14H (communications
    services) vector and services  requests  for  all  FOSSIL and
    non-FOSSIL aware programs using the INT 14H interface.

    BNU will NEVER  load  itself  more than once,  unless  within
    different tasks when    using    a   multitasker,   such   as
    PC-MOS/386(tm), DESQview(tm), DoubleDOS(tm) or VM/386(tm).

    This documentation assumes a working knowledge of MS-DOS, and
    no effort is made to explain MS-DOS  functions,  commands  or
    setup.  Some familiarity  with  BBS or mail capable  software
    and other FOSSIL drivers will definitely be an advantage, but
    not required.




                              USING BNU



    When running BNU,   avoid  using  any  other  software  which
    purports to enhance   communications    products   (such   as
    16550.EXE).  These WILL NOT work, and could cause your system
    to crash or work unreliably.  BNU already uses  the 16550 and
    16550AN to full advantage.

    Avoid loading DOS's   MODE   command   with   BNU.    BNU  is
    incompatible with it's communications  handling  -  if loaded
    after BNU, then  both may fail to operate reliably.   Printer
    redirection is usually  ok,  provided  MODE  is loaded before
    BNU.

    If you need to set a COM port's  baud rate (which is why MODE
    is most often  used),  then you can get BNU  to  do  that  by
    "locking" the baud  rate  (using  BNU /L as documented below)
    which sets the COM port immediately  to  that rate.  Remember
    to "unlock" the  baud  rate  if  not  using a constant  speed
    between computer and modem.

    BNU.COM would normally  be  loaded  in your AUTOEXEC.BAT, and
    installed as part of your normal  system  startup.  A typical
    command line might be:

         BNU /F
         [Loads BNU.COM with default settings and fast ANSI]

    BNU will respond  with  a  short  copyright   notice  and  an
    indication that it  has been successfully loaded.  The number
    of ports installed for will also be shown.



                                - 3 -


                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver
                                                     Version 1.70

    BNU.SYS must be  loaded  from CONFIG.SYS (and probably can be
    using QuarterDeck's DEVICE.COM under DESQview but I have only
    run it this way for short periods)  using  a  "device"  line,
    such as:

         device = C:\BNU.SYS /P2 /L0:19200,8N1 /F
         [Loads BNU.SYS  for  2  ports, port 0 (COM1)  locked  at
         19200 baud  8  data  bits 1 stop bit normal parity, fast
         ANSI]

    A similar copyright message is  displayed  as  an  indication
    that the driver has been installed.

    If BNU encounters  an error in the command line,  the  driver
    will NOT be  installed.   The  device driver version displays
    the command line parameter in error.

    BNU has been successfully run  loaded  "high"  above the 640K
    mark using both   QuarterDeck's   QEMM(tm)   and    Qualitas'
    386^MAX(tm) 386 memory  management  products.   It  should be
    noted that there may be performance  differences  as a result
    of either 386i  virtual  mode  switching  or  differences  in
    hardware RAM access  speeds between mother-board RAM and that
    used on an extended RAM card.  You should test the results on
    your own hardware before deciding  which  method  is  better,
    since generalisations without  considering  all  the  factors
    involved can be misleading.

    Other enhanced memory  products may or may not work, but I am
    either not familiar with them  or  do  not  know enough about
    them to comment.

    Since BNU.COM can  be  unloaded  at  any  time   (unless  BNU
    considers it unsafe to do so for various reasons), you should
    be aware that  doing  so sometimes creates "holes" in memory.
    This is not  a  problem  so   far   as   MS-DOS   or  various
    applications running in it are concerned, but  the  effect of
    releasing more memory  for  DOS  to use may be lost.  This is
    almost always the  case when unloaded  from  within  a  batch
    file: the memory freed will not be available until  after the
    batch file terminates.

    If the desired  effect  is to "disable" BNU completely, refer
    to the /Q and /C command line  switches  below.   This leaves
    BNU loaded, but  provides  a  means of disabling  the  driver
    completely and forces  use of the BIOS INT 14H functions or a
    previously installed driver.

    One note regarding PS/2 hardware  and  applications which use
    its specific INT  14H  functions  (though I haven't  actually
    seen any).  A PS/2's extended BIOS contains a superset of INT
    14H services, which  were designed after FOSSILs first become
    available for PC's.    The  additional   services   are   NOT
    compatible with the extended functions supported  by  FOSSIL,
    and you should  therefore  either  unload  (/U) or deactivate
    (/Q) BNU prior running such software.




                                - 4 -


                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver
                                                     Version 1.70

                           DEFAULT SETTINGS


    By default, BNU  uses  1K  (1024 byte) communications buffers
    for both transmit and receive.  This should be sufficient, if
    not excessive, for most applications.   This  may  need to be
    varied for systems  running  at slow (less than  6MHZ)  clock
    speeds, use modems  with  higher  baud  rates,  make  use  of
    special modem technology, run under  multitasking software or
    run on a  network.   Some applications (for example  terminal
    emulation systems and bulletin boards) require more buffering
    because of the nature of how they communicate.

    The fast 'ANSI' output is DISabled by default.  The option to
    use the faster  output  method  will normally work well under
    standard MS-DOS, DESQview  or  most  DOS-based  environments.
    This will NOT  work under PC-MOS/386 as it makes  use  of  an
    undocumented MS-DOS feature  not  supported by that operating
    system.

    After installation (only the first  successful  invocation of
    BNU.COM actually loads the TSR portion), the FOSSIL  driver's
    extended interrupt driven  functions  are  inactive, and only
    the basic BIOS   services  are   provided   (by   BNU).    An
    application must specifically   "initialise"   a   port   for
    communications to make it become active and use the interrupt
    driven functions.

    When BNU is  installed,  it  does a brief and simple hardware
    diagnostic to detect what communications ports are valid.  If
    errors are found  (most  PC BIOS'  miss  detection  of  16550
    USARTS, cannot detect  non-standard  communications  hardware
    and do not  look  for  anything  above COM2), the appropriate
    BIOS tables and hardware bits  are  patched.  This means that
    if you install and use non-standard port and IRQ settings for
    a communications card,  and  tell  BNU about these  (via  the
    BNUPORT utility) your  BIOS  will be changed to reflect this,
    allowing other BIOS-compatible    programs    to    use   the
    communications port (COM1 through COM4 only since the PC BIOS
    can only support up to 4 ports).




                         COMMAND LINE OPTIONS


    Following is a  list  of  command line options  available  in
    either or both   BNU.COM  and  BNU.SYS.   These  allow  "fine
    tuning", setup and utility functions.

    Command line switches can be given  with a preceding dash (-)
    or forward slash   (/).   Some  parameters   show   a   colon
    separating the switch itself and a numeric parameter: this is
    optional, and is  included  only  for readability.  An equals
    (=) or comma (,) are NOT optional  and must be included since
    these separate different parts of a command line switch.



                                - 5 -


                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver
                                                     Version 1.70

    There are basically  two  "groups"  of command line switches.
    The first are  configuration   switches,   which  affect  the
    tuning, performance   and  behaviour  of  the  communications
    driver.  These can  generally be combined on the same command
    line (and invocation) without problems.   Exceptions (if any)
    are noted where relevant.

    The second group are "utility" functions.  These switches are
    normally used EXCLUSIVELY of all other switches.  That is, if
    you use them, they must appear SEPARATELY on a  command line.
    The switches in this group are:

         /C        Recapture INT 14H vector
         /B        Reboot system unconditionally
         /S        Display driver status
         /H        Display help for command line switches
         /U        Unload driver from memory
         /W        Enable/disable carrier watch

    Remember that you  can  invoke BNU.COM multiple times with no
    risk in loading the communications  driver  portion more than
    once in any  logical  "task".   All  utilities   relating  to
    BNU.COM are contained within the same .COM file.

    The device driver  version  works  a little differently.  Its
    command line (specified  in  CONFIG.SYS)  must  contain  only
    configuration items, since the utilities are  not  supported.
    These are contained   within  a  separate  executable  called
    BNUHELP.COM, and have a similar  -  if not identical - syntax
    to the utility   functions   in   the   .COM  version.    Any
    differences are noted below.



                                 ~~~




    /T        Set Transmit buffer size
              Available in .SYS and .COM versions

         eg.  /T:512
              Sets 512 byte transmit buffers

         The default  transmit  buffer size is 1024 bytes.  Since
         file transfers are "transmitter  driven" so far as speed
         is concerned, this should be large enough to service the
         interrupt driven transmitter without it "waiting"  to be
         filled by the application.  These should be increased in
         size where  multitaskers,  networks or faster baud rates
         are being used.

                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver
                                                     Version 1.70

    /R        Set Receive buffer size
              Available in .SYS and .COM versions

         eg.  /R:2048
              Sets RX buffer size of 2048 (2K) bytes

         The default  RX  (receive)  buffer  size  is 1K, or 1024
         bytes.  In practice, only  a portion of this is actually
         used on a constant basis, but this will be  dependant on
         how fast an application can service the buffer (and keep
         it empty).

         Buffer sizes  CAN  be  changed  "on-the-fly".  But at no
         time can  both  the  receive  and  transmit  buffers  be
         increased in size beyond the combined amount  when first
         installed.  For  example,  if  BNU was installed with 2K
         transmit and 4K receive buffers, only 6K is available to
         each port in total.  Combined  buffer size cannot exceed
         that 6K.  An attempt to exceed this amount  will  result
         in an error.

         Changing buffer  sizes  whilst  communications tasks are
         active will be disallowed.

         When modifying the buffer  sizes,  it  is  advisable  to
         first specify  the  one  which is to "shrink"  in  size,
         before the  one  which  will "grow".  For example, if 1K
         buffers were active (with  a total of 2K available), and
         you wished  to  change  these  to .5K receive  and  1.5K
         transmit:

              BNU /T1536 /R512

         would result in an error (Maximum buffer size exceeded).
         The result  could  be  achieved by changing the order of
         the command line arguments to:

              BNU /R512 /T1536



    /P        Enable concurrent ports
              Available in .SYS and .COM versions

         eg.  /P:2
              Enables two ports for use concurrently

         This sets the number of ports which can be active at the
         same time.  Up to 4 ports  can  be used (in this current
         release), in up to 16 different configurations.

         By default, BNU enables one port for 'interrupt  driven'
         use.  This  is the most memory conservative approach and
         fits the requirements of the majority of installations.

         The current  version  does   not   support  shared  port
         arrangements or  multi-port  'intelligent'   serial   IO

                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver
                                                     Version 1.70


         This switch  does  not  determine  WHICH  ports  will be
         valid, only HOW MANY can run  FOSSIL driven at one time.
         The driver  will  support  whichever  port   (0-15)  the
         application selects.




    /L        Lock ports baud rate and/or settings
              Available in .SYS and .COM versions

         eg.  /L:0=19200
              Locks baud rate on port 0 (COM1) to 19200
              /L:1=38400,8N1
              Locks port 1 (COM2) to 38400, and forces 8
              data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit.
              /L:0=0,7E1
              Unlocks port 0 (COM1) if previously locked,
              or leaves it 'floating' if not, then forces
              7 data bits, even parity and 1 stop bit.

         The baud  rate given must be valid for a standard FOSSIL
         driver, and can be one of  0  (unlock)  300,  600, 1200,
         2400, 4800,  9600,  19200 or 38400.  High  speed  modems
         locked at a baud rate of 9600 or above also have CTS/RTS
         hand-shaking forced since these use the modem's internal
         buffering which make use of CTS/RTS flow control.

         A baud  rate  specification  of  zero "unlocks" the baud
         rate and resets handshaking  to  default  (whatever  the
         application sets).

         When using  this  switch,  your  modem  MUST  support  a
         constant modem  to  computer  speed,  otherwise any baud
         rate change requested by an application will be ignored,
         resulting in an incorrect  setting  between  your system
         and remote.  The result will normally be  garbled  input
         and output.

         When the  baud  rate  is locked, the port's baud rate is
         set IMMEDIATELY.  The baud  rate  is  maintained  at the
         locked rate  even  though  FOSSIL  is   not   active   -
         applications making  use  of  BIOS  calls to change baud
         rate will not succeed.   This  allows  non-FOSSIL  aware
         applications to  be run without fear of  the  baud  rate
         being changed   even  though  these  do  not  explicitly
         support higher baud rates.




    /F        Enables/disable 'fast' screen writes
              Available in .SYS and .COM versions

         eg.  /F+       Enables 'fast' screen writes
              /F-       Disables 'fast' screen writes

                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver
                                                     Version 1.70


         This switch  is  used  for versions of DOS which support
         faster character output  via  the  undocumented  INT 29H
         method (used to call the ANSI driver directly).   To  my
         knowledge, this  will  work  on  all  DOS  versions 2.00
         through 4.01, but since it  is  "undocumented", there is
         no guarantee that it will work.

         This should NOT be enabled under PC-MOS/386  version 4.0
         or below.




    /O        Enable function 0x1c compatibility
              Available in .SYS and .COM versions

         eg.  /O

         This switch  is used to enable "compatible" operation of
         BNU in situations where either  X00  or Opus!Com worked,
         but BNU  doesn't.   Due  to  a misunderstanding  of  the
         FOSSIL specification,  X00 and Opus!Com return 0x1c (28)
         whenever the highest function  number is requested by an
         application instead  of  0x1b  (27)  as   required   the
         Revision 5 specification (FSC-0015).

         Several applications  rely  on  the  'feature'  of these
         drivers and require a 0x1c  return  to  verify  that the
         functions used by the application are present.   At this
         time, a  function  0x1c  is  not actually implemented by
         X00.SYS, Opus!Com or BNU.

         When given, this switch tells BNU to return 0x1c, and so
         allows applications relying  on  0x1c  to  work with it.
         Typically, such  programs will return with  "FOSSIL  not
         present" or  "FOSSIL  version too old" (or words to that
         effect) when BNU is loaded without using '/O'.



    /Z        Sets 16550 FIFO size/trigger levels
              Available in .SYS and .COM versions

         eg.  BNU /Z0
              Enables full 16550 FIFO buffering (16/14)
              BNU /Z5
              Disables 16550 FIFO buffers

         This switch provides the ability to 'fine tune' a system
         equipped with  a National  Semiconductor  16550AN  UART.
         The UART  is  the  device used in PC's for  asynchronous
         communications handling,  and  the 16550AN is a superior
         form of these (as compared  to  an  8250  or  16450 with
         which it is pin-compatible), since it provides  on-board
         FIFO (first-in   first-out)   buffers   or   queues  for
         receiving and transmitting.



                                - 9 -


                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver
                                                     Version 1.70

         Software must be built to specifically take advantage of
         this UART's  features in order to gain any real benefit.
         Normally, the  16550's  FIFO  buffers  are  disabled  on
         power-up, and   remain  that  way  unless   specifically
         enabled.  The software itself must service interrupts by
         emptying and  filling  "queues"  rather  than the normal
         single character receive and transmit holding registers.
         Having this  ability  to   service   multiple  character
         requests in  one  hardware  interrupt   call   makes  it
         possible to   SIGNIFICANTLY   reduce  interrupt  service
         overhead and thus CPU usage  on  any  machine.  This has
         very obvious   advantages   when   operating   under   a
         multitasker, on   a  network,  concurrently  with  other
         heavily interrupt-driven devices or with modems or other
         communications devices running at high baud rates.

         The /Z switch takes a single  digit parameter - a number
         between 0  and  5.   This  number affects  the  internal
         settings of both the UART itself (its internal 'trigger'
         levels, which  define  how  "full"  the  FIFO's  will be
         allowed to get before triggering an interrupt to the CPU
         for service) and how full BNU will let the transmit FIFO
         be queue on each transmit 'request'.

         Valid numeric parameters to the /Z switch are:

              /Z0            16 bytes       14 bytes (max)
              /Z1            14 bytes       14 bytes (max)
              /Z2            08 bytes       08 bytes
              /Z3            04 bytes       04 bytes
              /Z4            01 byte        01 byte
              /Z5                - FIFOs disabled -

         Where 16550AN's  are  not   present,  BNU  automatically
         ignores this switch completely.   The default  value  is
         '/Z0', which activates the full 16550AN capability.



    /M        Enable/disable initialisation message
              Available in .SYS and .COM versions

         eg.  /M+  Enable init message
              /M-  Disables init message

         Normally the   driver   outputs   a   message   when  an
         applications initialises  the  driver for its use.  This
         may be suppressed or reenabled by using this switch.




    /U        Unload driver from memory
              Available in .COM version only

         eg.  BNU /U
              Attempts unloading resident driver from memory



                                - 10 -


                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver
                                                     Version 1.70

         This switch  tells BNU.COM to unload itself from memory.
         This forces all ports to  be  deactivated  (if  any  are
         active).  This  will fail if programs loaded  after  BNU
         have "captured"  interrupt vectors which are used by BNU
         (and which BNU cannot restore  as  a  result).   In this
         case, BNU will not load, but will indicate  this  in  an
         error message.    You  will  have to either unload these
         later programs (such as FOSSIL  appendages),  or  reboot
         your system.

         Since BNU.SYS is a device driver, it cannot  be disabled
         or unloaded from memory.



    /Q        Disable communications driver interface
              Available in .SYS and .COM versions

         eg.  BNU /Q
              Disables resident driver

         This switch  is normally given when BNU installs itself,
         and the effect is to "delay"  capturing  of  the INT 14H
         vector until  a  '/C' command is issued.   This  may  be
         useful if  loading  with  a  multitasker and using other
         incompatible communications drivers in other tasks.

         If issued while BNU is already  loaded,  the  previously
         active INT   14H  communications  services   vector   is
         restored.  BNU's    extended    FOSSIL    services   are
         effectively "dropped" out of the chain.



    /B        System reboot

         eg.  BNU /B0
              Select default reboot method
              BNU /B
              Reboot (warm)

         This switch has two uses.   When  a digit is given after
         the 'B', the reboot method is selected.  Only two values
         are valid 0 or 1.

         Method 0 selects a standard BIOS method  of  jumping  to
         the system's  reset  vector.  This should work with most
         DOS environments on a wide  range of hardware, including
         PC/XT/AT and 386 compatibles.

         Method 1 makes use of the AT's keyboard  reset  line  to
         cause a  system  reboot.   It  will  work only on AT and
         386AT systems.  However,  this  method  will  work under
         some 386 specific software where the first  method  does
         not.  (for  example,  PC-MOS/386).   In short, it "plays
         rough".  Some 386 machines  and almost all PC/XT systems
         cannot and should not use this method.

         If no  digit  is  given  after  the 'B', BNU proceeds to
         reboot the machine - unconditionally.



    /H or /?  Display help information
              Available in .COM version only

         This switch  displays  information  about  command  line

         reading manuals is a very useful exercise.  Pity they'll

    /C        Recapture INT 14H vector
              Available in .COM version only

         eg.  BNU /C
              Recapture INT 14H
              (must not be used with any other switches!)

         This forces BNU to takes a look at the current  location
         of INT  14H  and  makes  sure  that  it  points into the
         resident portion of BNU.   If not, it resets the INT 14H
         address to the correct location.

         This is most often necessary when using a  multitasker -
         such as  DESQview(tm) - which revectors the interrupt on

                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver

         loading.  Since  one  standard  method  of detecting the
         presence of a FOSSIL driver is to examine memory shortly
         after the location pointed  to  by the INT 14H interrupt
         vector, the  'stealing'  of the interrupt  in  this  way
         causes many  applications  to  fail to locate the FOSSIL
         driver.  Applications which  use  the  'init  signature'
         method of detecting a FOSSIL driver will not normally be
         affected by this behaviour, but there  is  a  risk  that
         whatever 'stole'  the vector will unintentionally change
         CPU registers used by the  application  for  the  FOSSIL
         call, causing any number of complications  (and probably
         a system crash!).

         Another use  of  this switch might be to enable toggling
         between two or more communications  drivers  which  make
         use  of  INT  14H  (such  as packet radio communications
         drivers).  '/Q'  can  be  used  to  switch BNU "off" and
         restore a previous vector, and '/C' used to recapture it
         again for FOSSIL use.  The  following  sequence  is  the
         suggested method of doing this:

           BNU /Q [other switches]
                 (Install but don't vector INT 14H)
           <install other communications driver>
           BNU /C
                 (Capture INT 14H saving previous vector)

         To use the secondary driver (which could even be another
         FOSSIL driver,  but cannot be BNU), use  "BNU  /Q",  and
         "BNU /C" to use BNU again.


         NOTE: This  switch  MUST NOT be combined with any others
         (since they will be ignored)!



    /W        Enable/disable carrier watchdog

         eg.  BNU /W0+
              Enables carrier watchdog on port 0 (COM1)
              BNU /W1-
              Disables carrier watch on port 1 (COM2)

         This switch  enables or disables  carrier  watch  for  a
         particular communications port.  If carrier detect drops
         (the caller  hangs  up) while the watchdog  function  is
         active, the system will be rebooted.

         This feature  is most often used with programs which are
         not "carrier smart" and do  not monitor carrier detect -
         some of these were probably never intended  to  run with
         output directed  to  a communications port.  If a caller
         hangs up while such a program  requests input, it may be
         effectively "stuck", unable to continue until  its input
         is satisfied.    It is possible that this situation also
         presents a security risk.

         The carrier  detect watchdog is not an elegant nor ideal
         solution to this problem,  and  especially not useful in
         multitasking or networked computing environments,  where
         rebooting of   a   whole   machine   could  upset  other
         concurrently running tasks  and workstations.  There are
         some very clever "watchdog" programs which are much more
         suitable to do this, such as Angelo Besani's(++) WABIRD,
         which gracefully terminates the program and restores the
         system to the state it was in when originally invoked.

         Ommission of  the  '+'  or '-' is considered  an  error.
         This switch MUST be used exclusive of all others.

              Available in .COM version only

         eg.  BNU /S
              Displays BNU's current status

         The resulting  display  will depend on the current state
         of the resident version of  the driver in memory, but if
         loaded will normally look similar to:

         If the driver is not yet installed, only  the first line
         will be  shown,  with  the  text  "Not  Installed".  The
         diagnostics module (explained below) is one of "Active",
         "Inactive" (present but disabled)  or "Not loaded".  Any
         ports whose  baud  rate  has  been "locked"  are  listed
         sequentially.

         Note that  port  numbers are ZERO-BASED.  Port 0 is what
         DOS refers to COM port 1  (ie.  the device COM1), port 1
         is COM2  etc.    DOS does not define devices  for  ports
         above port 3, though BNU can utilise them.

    /D        Enable/disable or install diagnostics module

         eg.  BNU /D2+
              On BNU install: Installs the diagnostics panel with
                              a default 'refresh' rate of 2, and
                              enabled (the '+' here is optional)
              Otherwise:      Provided the diagnostics module has
                              been installed, enables it and sets
                              the 'refresh' rate to 2
              BNU /D-
              Disables diagnostics screen updating (but does not
              deactivate them)

         This is   an   advanced   option,  useful  for  software
         development using FOSSIL  calls  as  a  means of viewing
         what the current state of the FOSSIL driver  is in 'real
         time'.  When  enabled  and  a  port is active for FOSSIL
         extended calls, a panel is  continually refreshed on the
         screen during each timer tick which displays  a  summary
         of various FOSSIL driver states.

         Information for   up   to   4  ports  can  be  displayed
         concurrently on the screen (thought this might get a bit
         messy!), overlaying anything currently displayed.

         By default, the "refresh rate" of the panel(s) is set to
         0, which means it is refreshed EVERY timer tick, or at a
         rate of about 18.2 times per second.  Refresh rates of 1
         means every second tick, 2  every third, 3 every fourth,
         and so  on.   Since video memory is slower  than  normal
         RAM, slowing  down  the  refresh  rate will decrease the
         overall detrimental  effect   that  diagnostics  has  on
         system performance.

         It should  be  noted  that  running  diagnostics   quite
         significantly impedes  system  performance  and  adds  a
         great deal  of  CPU  overhead   in   servicing  what  is
         effectively a "background" task.  You can therefore only
         run diagnostics  on a system equipped with  a  fast  CPU
         (286 or  above), running at lower baud rates and/or with
         a 16550AN UART.  Some general 'minimal' guide-lines are:

           ş 2400 baud or below
              ù 6-8MHZ 286 class
              ù 16450 UART or better

           ş 9600 baud
              ù 10-16MHZ 286 class  -or-   ù 20MHZ 386 class
              ù 16550 UART                  ù 16450 UART

           ş 19200 baud
              ù 16-20MHZ 286/386 class
              ù 16550AN UART

         It takes quite a bit of  processing  power  to  drive  a
         'background' routine  to  refresh video  RAM  (which  is
         relatively slow)    without    impacting    on    system
         performance.

                      BNU Revision 5 FOSSIL Communications Driver
                                                     Version 1.70


         If you  are  having  any  difficulties  at all using the
         driver and have enabled the  diagnostics  panel, disable
         them immediately and try again.  I have found this to be
         a major cause of problems in the past.  This  feature is
         officially 'not  supported'  under any conditions, and I
         certainly don't need to hear that it "does" or "doesn't"
         work on your system.  Before  ANY problem report is made
         for any reason whatsoever, please try whatever  you  are
         trying to achieve WITHOUT DIAGNOSTICS LOADED!

         Usual symptoms  of  the diagnostics panel impacting in a
         detrimental way on a system's ability to communicate are
         failed handshaking   between   Fidonet   mailers,   poor
         resilience in file transfers when "task" switching under
         multitasking software, some spurious character loss from
         remote during terminal sessions, failure to initialise a
         modem and  inability  to detect incoming  calls  from  a
         modem returning    verbose   response   codes   (amongst
         others...).

         When loaded (which must be  done  via the /D switch when
         BNU is initially installed), you can selectively  enable
         or disable  the diagnostics display from a keyboard "hot
         key".  The window is in an  initial  "on" state, but can
         be toggled  on or off by pressing LeftShift-Ctrl-5  (the
         '5' located  on the numeric keypad).  The 'refresh rate'
         can also  be adjusted on-the-fly  using  LeftShift-Ctrl-
         Grey+ and LeftShift-Ctrl-Grey-.  The panel itself can be
         shifted on the screen by holding down the LeftShift-Ctrl
         combination and pressing Up, Down, Left and  Right arrow
         keys.  Note  that  the background screen is NOT restored
         (since it is never saved).

         In summary:

           Left-Shift     Action

           Numeric 5      Toggle panel "off" and "on"
           Grey+/Grey-    Speed up/slow down panel refresh rate
           Arrow keys     Move diagnostics panel on screen

         Note that these 'hot-keys'  work, no matter if the panel
         is visible  or  not, but not if disabled  using  the  /N
         switch.

         Toggling the  panel  "off"  using LS-5 does not entirely
         defeat the CPU overhead required  to  service the panel.
         In that case, the background task is still  active,  and
         only the  panel  is  not displayed.  To entirely disable
         the diagnostics  panel, either  unload  and  reload  BNU
         without the  /D  switch, or use "BNU /N" to  effectively
         turn it off.

         The following  diagram shows a typical diagnostics panel
         display, and explains the  fields  shown.    All numeric
         values are hexadecimal (base 16).

         If you want to load diagnostics but have them completely
         inactive by   default,  use  the  following  batch  file
         sequence:

              REM Load diagnostics module when installing BNU
              BNU -D <other switches ...>
              REM Immediately disable them
              BNU -N

         The option to load without  screen  refresh "/Dn-" still
         uses clock cycles: only the screen update is inhibited.

         The "/N"   switch   actually  disables  the   background
         processing and   will   not  cause  any  degradation  in
         performance.  "/D" can be  used  to  reenable the module
         again.




    /N        Disable diagnostics panel

         eg.  BNU /N

         This switch disables output of diagnostic information to
         the screen, and also the background processing  required
         to update it.

    /A        Set diagnostics panel attribute

         eg.  BNU /A=79
              Causes the  diagnostics  panel  to  become  intense
              white on red

         This allows the physical screen attribute to be set.  By
         default, a colour screen uses  dark blue on white, and a
         monochrome screen reverse video.



    /I        Init/deinit FOSSIL enhanced functions

         eg.  BNU /I0+
              Initialise port 0 (COM1) for FOSSIL processing
              BNU /I1-
              Deinitialise port 1 (COM2)

         This provides the facility to force normally  non-FOSSIL
         aware BIOS  compatible  programs to use the basic FOSSIL
         character input/output functions.

         This has  specific  advantages   when  running  under  a
         multitasker, since  all  input/output is from  interrupt
         serviced buffers,   and   not   directly   polling   the
         communications port for activity.

         Not all non-FOSSIL aware  programs  will  be  compatible
         with use  of this option.  Only strictly  BIOS-compliant
         programs will benefit.  Some program will have their own
         interrupt driven  communications  functions,  and others
         will poll the port directly.  Initialising the FOSSIL in
         this way MAY interfere with  correct  operation of these
         programs.




                         GENERAL INFORMATION


    The following sections outline how best to utilise the driver
    and get the best performance from it on your hardware setup.


    INSTALLATION

    BNU.COM is usually installed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT  or at some
    time before you    load    your    communications   software.
    Alternatively, MS-DOS 4.xx has  an option to allow loading of
    some 'compatible' TSRs using an "install=" statement  in your
    CONFIG.SYS.  A major  benefit  of  this  is  that  BNU can be
    loaded before any environment variables are set, and so takes
    up the absolute minimum of RAM.   However, as with the device
    driver when loaded   from  CONFIG.SYS,  BNU.COM   cannot   be
    unloaded from memory using the "/U" option.

                                                     Version 1.70


    ERRORLEVELS

    The following errorlevels are returned by BNU (this also
    documents some of the possible errors which can be returned):


         0    No error - operation(s) successful
         1    Status was requested and displayed
         2    A FOSSIL driver other than BNU is present
         3    Incompatible version of BNU is already loaded
         4    Can't modify parameters with ports active
         5    BNU is not yet resident or loaded
         6    Not used
         7    DOS memory allocation error - fatal abort
         8    Invalid command line option
         9    Can't unload - FOSSIL appendages are loaded
         10   System reboot failure
         11   Error enabling or disabling carrier watch
         12   Unable to recapture INT 14H vector
         13   Can't unload if installed from CONFIG.SYS
         14   Maximum combined TX/RX buffer size exceeded
         15   Can't disable/enable diags panel - not loaded
         16   Unable to unload due to interrupt chaining
         17   Problem initialising FOSSIL (with /I)




    MULTITASKERS

    Prior versions of BNU directly supported various multitaskers
    by allowing for  "poll" detection on status and character I/O
    calls made to the FOSSIL.  When BNU sensed a task was "idle",
    it automatically gave  time slices  up  during  "polling"  to
    other tasks in the system.

    This internal multitasker  support  has  been   removed  from
    BNU.COM and BNU.SYS,   and   the   /X  switch  is  no  longer
    implemented.  However, the current  version  of BNU does have
    'hooks' for an installable driver to link into  BNU and carry
    out this task.   This  eliminates  much  of  the  unnecessary
    "baggage" suffered by users  of  BNU  who  do  not  need this
    feature.  It also  eliminates  code  made  redundant  by  not
    having all multitasker   time   slice   resident   at   once,
    irrespective of which specific  multitasker  is in use.  Only
    that code which is actually used and plays a part  in support
    of the multitasker itself is loaded.

    While this current release (1.70) is not accompanied by these
    drivers (which are   now   [October,  1989]  in  beta  test),
    multitasking appendages for DESQview/TopView  and  PC-MOS/386
    will soon be available.

    MEMORY


    BNU.COM is approximately  11K  in size.  It is made up of the
    following main parts:


    Description           Size  Used by
    Resident
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    ISR Device Driver     0.5K  Common 4 ports   Yes
    INT 14H Despatcher    4.5K  Common 4 ports   Yes
    Diagnostics Model     1.0K  Common 4 ports   Optional
    Initialisation/Setup  1.0K  Run time only    Discarded
    Command line utility  4.0K  Run time only    Discarded
    -------------------------------------------------------------

    What eventually remains resident  depends  upon  what command
    line options are used.  Initial overhead is about  5K for the
    ISR and despatcher.   If  diagnostics are used (rarely), then
    add 1K. Add to this, the sum  of  the  transmit  and  receive
    buffers times the number of communications ports selected.



    THE DIAGNOSTICS PANEL

    The ability to  view the state of the FOSSIL driver  is  very
    useful when developing  software  utilising FOSSIL calls.  It
    can also be an invaluable aid in  "tuning" the driver to your
    machine.  Memory is precious - especially in  a  multitasking
    environment, and most  of  the time, the standard 1K transmit
    and receive buffers are far too  much  to allocate.  This can
    only be empirically tested.

    Instead of "guessing" and using trial and error  to  see  how
    well the driver  performs,  it  is  much better to enable the
    diagnostics window.  This provides a 'snapshot' of the driver
    18.2 times per second (each clock  tick).   Particular fields
    to look at are:


         "TX Cnt"  Indicates how full the transmit  buffer  is in
                   bytes.

         "TX Max"    This  is  the  current  'maximum'  count  if
                   characters in the  transmit buffer detected by
                   the diagnostics routine (it views  the  driver
                   in 'snapshots'   so   cannot   be   completely
                   accurate.

         "RX Cnt"  Indicates how full  the  receive  buffer is in
                   bytes.

         "RX Max"   Maximum count of characters  in  the  receive
                   buffer (see TX Max).

         "Int14h"  Particularly  useful  for  monitoring  program
                   activity.  This  counter ticks over every time
                   the running  application  requests   a  FOSSIL
                   service.

         "Errors"  Locates  possible  problems in the program you
                   are running.  Any  time  the  program makes an
                   "illegal" call  (usually  incorrect   register
                   values).  The   last   FOSSIL   function  code
                   invoked which  triggered  the  error  will  be
                   displayed next to "ErrFun".


    By observation, it is possible to calculate the  optimum size
    for both receive and transmit buffers.



    16550 USART SUPPORT

    BNU fully supports  the  16550 USART in buffered mode.  Using
    the /Z command line switch, you  can  decrease  the amount of
    FIFO buffering used, or disable the FIFO's completely.

    This option has  been  included for "compatibility"  reasons.
    Previous releases of   BNU   used  the  equivalent  of  "/Z2"
    buffering, whereas this release  defaults  to full use of the
    FIFO queues.  If you have problems using the default "/Z0"
    setting, try reducing  first to "/Z1", then "/Z2"  or  lower,
    and once you've found a setting that works, please contact me
    (I'm interested in  know what sort of setup this DOESN'T work
    on).



    BETA VERSIONS


    Versions of BNU will either be  BETA  TEST  versions  or full
    releases.   Public release versions are numbered  ending with
    a zero and  carry  no  "alpha",  "beta", "gamma" etc. suffix.
    Beta test releases carry an suffix  after the version number,
    and will be  numbered  ending  with  a  non-zero  digit  (for
    identification of incremental versions).

    Beta releases of  the  BNU driver are not publicly available.
    These are generally requestable from a number of systems, but
    are be restricted for use by beta testing sites only.  If you
    would like to assist in beta testing  future beta versions of
    BNU, request "BNUINFO"  (magic  name)  WaZoo   from   Fidonet
    3:632/348 (or Alternet 7:833/387).

    Beta releases are,   by  nature,  less  stable  than  release
    versions.  If you obtain one, please  do NOT distribute it by
    posting it for download or file request.

    PROBLEM REPORTS


    If you have  problems  in  getting BNU to run on your system,
    remember that I cannot solve that  problem if you do not take
    the time to  let  me know.  If you do decide  to  pursue  any
    problem, please give  as much detail regarding your system as
    possible so that I can more readily  evaluate  why  something
    may or may  not  be  occurring.  Please keep the  information
    relevant (ie. I  don't need to know your shoe size, but I may
    want to know what's in your CONFIG.SYS!).


    Some information I'll probably need:

         o    Machine type/model and class (XT/AT/386 etc.)

         o    Type of USARTs installed (8250/16450/16550 etc.)

         o    Communications software you're running

         o    Contents of your AUTOEXEC.BAT/CONFIG.SYS or other
              batch files which may be relevant

         o    Switches used to load BNU.COM

         o    Whether  you've  used   BNUPORT   to   change  port
              assignments

         o    Brief description of modem if at all unusual ie.
              high speed, non-standard or sub-standard<grin>

         o    Version of MS-DOS in use

         o    Multitasker in use (if any), including version

         o    Other TSR's loaded during communications activity

         o    What other FOSSIL drivers have worked in the past

         o    An accurate and complete (oh, I wish!)  description
              of your problem

         o    Contents of a diagnostics window when the problem
              is occurring (if at all possible)

         o    If  you  have  TurboPower's TSR utilities or Andrew
              Wylie's DOSMAP program  (or some similar DOS memory
              control block  mapping  utility),   then   redirect
              output of  this  to a file and include it with your
              report.  Try to duplicate the exact state of memory
              when the problem occurs.   Then  execute a command,
              something like:

                   "mapmem -v -h >output.mem"

    DEVELOPERS!


    BNU is currently being restructured to use an alternative far
    call model, instead  of  the  INT  14H  interface.  This will
    follow the same lines as a FOSSIL  appendage, and is expected
    to yield significant performance benefits for  DOS as well as
    benefits for the developer by allowing more direct high level
    language access.

    Enquiries regarding this project should be directed to any of
    the electronic addresses   listed   at   the  start  of  this
    document.



    SUPPORT

    An echomail conference originating  from  my  system (Fidonet
    3:632/348) called "BNU"  is  available  for general  use  for
    support of BNU   and   related  programs.   Topic  areas  are
    generally BNU related but also  cover a wider area, including
    FOSSIL communications, general  usage,  software  development
    using FOSSIL and 'tricks'.

    Please forward any enquiries regarding this conference to me.



    THANKS!

    Thank you to  the  many  people involved in helping the "BNU"
    project, especially those of you  willing  (and silly enough)
    to run beta  versions  on your own systems and  tolerate  the
    problems.  Without the  support of these people, I would have
    given up long ago.

    Special thanks to  Paul  Marwick   of   3:640/820   for   his
    painstaking assistance in beta testing, the high quality (and
    quantity!) of his reports and observations and by helping
    by proof-reading this documentation.  And to  his  poor users
    for putting up with "would you like to try something for
    me?" ...  :-)
