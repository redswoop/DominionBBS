     Dominion BBS was designed to be Morphic.  That is, the BBS has very
     little definate shape or form.  Most of it is up to the SysOp to decide.
     With time and effort, Any Dominion can be unique.  But since this ofcourse
     is difficult, a sample setup is included for the SysOp to become
     familiar with how things work. We feel that Dominion represents the
     BBS community as a nice, user friendly software package that is
     easy to set up, yet powerful enough to set it apart from other
     software in its class.

     Dominion  was  written and compiled using the Turbo C++ v3.0
     compiler.

                       ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

     Dominion  was  designed to be used with the following  minimum  system
     configuration:

          ş    IBM PC/XT/AT (or true compatible) or PS/2


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 3


          ş    Hard disk drive (10 megabytes minimum)
          ş    512K RAM (more is preferable)
          ş    80 column monochrome or color monitor
          ş    Modem (1200 baud or greater; Hayes compatible is preferred)
          ş    MS-DOS version 5.0 or later

     A  start-up package is distributed under the name Domxxx.ZIP,  where
     "xxx"  indicates  the  version  number  in  question.   This  archive
     contains complete documentation concerning the setup of a new system.
     Read the File Domxxx.nfo for more information.

     Alpha  and Beta sites (as well as most Standard sites) will  have  the
     latest  Standard release, and will distribute them at no  cost  (other
     than  the  phone call to download the program!).   Hopefully,  updates
     will  be  released on a regular basis, but we are unable to  give  any
     kind of schedule.

     Since  Alpha  and  Beta sites perform testing  of  newer  versions  of
     Dominion before it is released Standard, you might want to call  those
     boards  to keep up with the latest features.  We are adding  them  all
     the time!

     Experiment; it's a big system, and you're not going to learn it all in
     one sitting.  If you need help and/or information concerning the setup
     and  operation  of  a  Dominion system, you may  contact  one  of  the
     Dominion  Alpha or Beta sites.  Since the installed base  of  Dominion
     systems  is growing by leaps and bounds, you should check the list  of
     Dominion  systems  (included with every Standard release) for  a  site
     near you.


     There are currently 2 official Dominion Alpha Sites:

     Please feel free to call these two systems if you are looking for help
     with your Dominion System.  They will generally have the newest
     version of Dominion available for download.

                      ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

     Starting up Dominion is rather simple.  Once it is properly installed,
     simply type 'dom' from any directory on your harddrive.  Assuming that
     Dominion's directory is in the System Path, and the DOM enviromental
     variable is set, the BBS will Clear the screen, and load up with a
     Updating Status Bar indicating how much is left.


     There  are also several command line options you can use to alter  the
     functioning  of  the system.  These options can be entered  in  either
     upper or lower case:

          /Bxxxxx   Answer the phone and force the baud rate to "xxxxx".
                    Note that the "answer phone" string is NOT sent to the
                    modem.  This option will find the most use when
                    executing the system from a front-end mailer (refer to
                    "Using Dominion With FidoNet" for more information).
          /I        Load Dominion in Quiet Mode.
          /M        Operate the BBS in local mode only (don't send anything
                    out to the modem, and don't respond to incoming calls).
          /Q        Quit to DOS after the next user logs off.
          /Px       ComPort to use with System.  This Overrides what is set
                        in the config program.
          /Nx       Node Number. If not specified, Multinode Mode will
                        be off.
          /H        Leave Carrier up when user logs off
          /C        Enable Flow Control
          /Ax       FidoNet Scanner/Tosser Command (S>can, P>urge, T>oss)

     When Loading is completed, Dominion enters Wait For Caller
     (WFC) mode.  The WFC screen is where the  BBS  sits while waiting
     for the next caller.  The commands available from  this screen  are
     displayed, as well as  the  following constantly-updated
     information:

          Time        - The current time and date.
          Feedback    - The number of Email messages the SysOp has waiting.
          DLs         - The number of files downloaded for the day.
          ULs         - The number of files uploaded for the day.
          % Activity  - The percentage of activity for the day.
          Disk Space  - The total amount of remaining disk space.
          SysOp       - SysOp Availabilty
          Calls Today - The Number of Calls Today
          Posts Today - The Number of Posts Today
          Last Caller - Last User to Logon to Board


     The  commands  available from the WFC screen are explained  in  detail
     below.   In most cases, there is a chapter in this manual  devoted  to
     the  command in question (such as the message and file  base  editors,
     and the system configuration command).

          A         Sends the "answer phone" command to the modem.  It is
                    used mainly for situations where you have your system
                    "hard-wired" to another system for testing purposes.
                    In most cases, the BBS will automatically answer the
                    phone by itself.

          B         Enters the message base editor, where you can enter and
                    modify the bases used to store public messages.

          C         Conference Editor.  Edit Conferences used to store
                    Message areas in.

          S         Run the String Editor.  This allows you to customize
                    the 'Strings' that the BBS displays to the user.
                    
          D         Shells to DOS, allowing you to perform maintenance and
                    other functions that aren't available through Mini-DOS.
                    To return to the WFC menu, use the DOS "EXIT" command.

          F         Enters the file base editor, where you can enter and
                    modify the bases used to store files for uploading and
                    downloading by users.

                    posted.  It does not allow for the viewing of a
                    specific individual's Email (use the "R" command for
                    that).








          O         Enters the system configuration, where you can perform
                    most of the major changes and modifications to the BBS.

          Q         Exits the BBS and returns to DOS.

          R         Read Feedback.  Acutally, it allows you to read
                    any mail waiting for the sysop.

          T         If a batch file named "TERM.BAT" exists, Dominion will
                    execute it.  This is mainly used to call an external
                    terminal program.

          U         Enters the user editor, where you can modify the
                    modify the information for each user of the BBS.

          W         Allows you to send Email messages to other users,

     There  are  many functions available to you via  function  keys,  both
     while  a  user is online (or while you are online locally)  and  while
     you're performing local maintenance.  These function keys are used  to
     perform  maintenance, change a user's security information, and  other
     operations.


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 8



     The following function keys are available only when a user is online:

          [Alt-Fxx]      Change Users Security Profile to Profile xx.
                         The Security Profiles can be edited via
                         the Configuration Section of Dominion
                         

          <F1>           Allows modification of the user's security
                         information (SL, DSL, AR & DAR flags, etc).
                         Prints the "SysOp working" message while this
                         window is displayed.


          <Shift-F1>     Activates 'Global Trapping'.  This will save
                         everything outputted to the screen to disk,
                         in the file GLOBAL.TXT in your AFILES directory

          <F2>           Switches the SysOp information windows between the
                         normal 5-line window and the extended 11-line
                         window.  If the window is not on, [F2] will turn
                         it on.

          <F3>           Toggles the user's keyboard on and off.  This
                         doesn't actually disable the user's keyboard, it
                         only tells the system to ignore any keystrokes
                         coming from the user (which has the EFFECT of
                         disabling the user's keyboard).  Ever been in chat
                         mode and couldn't get a word in edgewise?  This is
                         the function key for you!


          <Shift-F3>     Toggles the user's screen on and off.  Again, this
                         doesn't actually disable the user's screen, it
                         only tells the system not to send any output to
                         the user (which has the EFFECT of disabling the
                         user's screen).


          <F4>           Turns off the "user attempted to chat" note.
                         Which will make your PC stop screeching (if
                         you have a screeching chat call), and beeping
                         (if you have a beeping chat call).  It also
                         removes the chat reason message from your
                         SysOp Window.

          <F5>           Hangs up on a user immediately and returns to the
                         WFC menu.


          <Control-F5>   Hangs up on a user by faking a time out.  That is
                         the BBS will displays its 3 minute inactivity notice,
                         then drop carrier.


          <Shift-F5>     Prints fake "line noise" (random ASCII characters)
                         before hanging up on the user and returning to
                         the WFC menu.


          <F6>           Toggles "beep-after-end" on and off.  This feature
                         will, when activated, take the phone offhook and
                         sound an alarm when the user logs off, thus
                         letting you know that the system is available.


          <F7>           Subtracts five minutes from a user's total time
                         left.


          <F8>           Adds five minutes to a user's total time left.


          <F9>           Toggles temporary SysOp access for a user.  If
                         temporary SysOp access is still active when the
                         user logs off, the user's statistics are returned
                         to normal.  USE ONLY WITH TRUSTED USERS!!!

          <Ctrl  F10>    Take the User into your NON Default Chat Mode


          <Home>         Toggles the chat capture buffer on and off (used
                         while in one line chat mode.)

          <Alt-Z>        Quick BBS Exit.  This will exit the BBS, and
                         save the posistion of the user.  When you rerun the
                         BBS, it will load up to that exact spot.


          <Alt-X>        Exit BBS with Optional Save.  The same as above,
                         but the SysOp is prompted if they want to exit,
                         And the posistion save can be not used.


          <Alt+0-9>      If the file(s) WFCBATx.bat exists (X is a number from
                         0-9), then the corresponding batch file will be
                         executed. Crafty for doing things like running
                         external chat programs, and the like.


          <Scroll Lock>  Toggles the "SysOp available for chat" flag on and
                         off.  When the [Scroll Lock] light on the keyboard
                         is off, the SysOp is available; when the light is
                         on, the SysOp is unavailable.  SysOp chat hours
                         (defined in the System Configuration) will over-
                         ride this.

     The following commands are available during a 'BEEP' Type Chat Page
     (defineable in the config) :

          <CR>           During the Chat Beep Chat Call, pressing [Enter]
                         will stop the system from beeping for the rest of
                         the user online's call. Very useful for a user that
                         KNOWS you are there, but you do not wish to chat
                         with. This makes him think that you are being paged,
                         but your speaker will not beep.

          <Space Bar>    During the Chat Beep Chat Call, this will cause the
                         system to enter your default chat type (defined in
                         the config).

     Once a NewUser has loged onto the system for the first time and
     made their account, the System will set their security to the
     Profile selected in the New User Data section of the main
     Configuration.  While the users security remains the same as the
     New User Profile, the system will consider them as "Unvalidated".
     Unvalidated may not recieve the system password from the Matrix

     Logon.  This is a good means by which to screen your users before
     you decide whether to allow them on the system or not.  Once their
     security changes, they are considered validated, and can get the
     system password.

     Security Profiles as a quick, convienent way of organizing your System's
     features by the users access levels.  By giving one set of users one
     profile, another set another one, etc, when assigning Access Levels to your
     message areas, file areas, conferences, or menu commands, you won't have
     much trouble figuring out who can do what or who can see what.

     The quickest way to Validate a user is by assigning him/her a profile
     either while online via the Quick Profile keys (Alt-F1 - F10), or by
     using the '|' command from the User Editor.

     File Transfers have become very important in modern BBS softwares.
     Dominion's File System is among the best available.  It contains
     just about every feature that any competiting software offers.
     Its Downloading/Uploading system in particular is especially advanced,
     being oriented completely around Mulitple Batch Transfers.
     It uses File Point Ratio, File Byte Ratio, Post Call Ratio to keep the
     number of uploads to downloads decent.  File Validation ensures that
     a user cannot upload trash and download a valuable file with the ratio
     they recieve from it, as well as protecting other users from a possible
     bad upload.  Archive Manipulation allows commenting of files, addition of
     data to them, integrity checks, etc.  Configurable fileformats also allow
     the utmost in customization of the look and feel.

                               ³Uploads³
                               ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

     When a file is uploaded to the system, it arrives in the System
     Batch Directory.  The first thing done to it is a Archive Integrity
     check.  This will ensure that there are no problems with the file.
     Since the command line for this is configurable, you can specify a
     virus scanner to run along with the integrity checker.

     Once the BBS is statisfied that the file is good, it will proceed


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 12


     to comment the file, again with a configurable command line, so any
     advertising the SysOp wishes can be added to it.  It will also
     check for a FILE ID, a file called FILE_ID.DIZ added by the uploads
     creator, which may contain a precise description of what exactly
     the file is.  If this file is not found in the archive, an extended
     description by the uploader may be entered.

     If it passes all steps, it will then be moved to the the current file
     directory's true path, and added to the file lists.

     If the system uses File Validation, then the file will be marked as
     UnValidated.  The uploader will recieve no credit for the file until
     the SysOp validates it, using the File Validation CmdType(FV),
     or '/V' from the file area menu of a default system.

                              ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

     Dominion has several ways of ensuring that a user is going to
     download a file fairly.  Before any file is added to the download
     batch, several things are checked.

        1.  Does the User have enough time to download this file?
        2.  Does the user have enough file points for this file?
        3.  Does the user's file byte ratio meet the system required ratio?
        4.  Does the user's post call ratio meet the system required ratio ?
        5.  Is the File actually present on the disk?
        6.  Is the file Validated?

     If even one of these criteria is not met, the user may not download.
     Before the actual download is started, a second time check will
     happen, checking to see if the total batch time is more than the users
     time left.

     Certain Users may be exempt from the above criteria through the use of
     exemptions (given to the user either through <F1> while he is online or
     in the User Editor) :
      1. Time Limit Check [Exemption: T]
      2. File Ratio Check (Includes any/all active ratios) [Exemption: R]
      3. Post Call Ratio Check [Exemption: P]
      4. User will not be shown in User List (call logs, etc) [Exemption: U]

     File areas do not organize themselves, the SysOp must partake in the
     not so dirty deed.  Dominion provides several functions for making this
     easier.

        File Information Editor: This allows editing of specific file
                                 information, such as its description,
                                 name, file points, etc. (CmdType: F2)

                                 applicable (CmdType: F9)

        Gif Descriptions       : Dominion can scan gifs, and add their
                                 resolution to the description of the file
                                 (CmdType: F0)

        FILE ID Adder          : Dominion supports the FILE_ID.DIZ format
                                 for extended file info from its maker
                                 (CmdType: F!)

        Removing Files         : This deletes files from the file lists,
                                 and optionally the disk. (CmdType: FR)

        Killing Offline        : This will allow you to remove files which
                                 no longer exist on the disk from your file
                                 lists. (CmdType: F4)

        Moving Offline Files   : This allows you to move files that no longer
                                 exist on the disk to another directory.
                                 Good for 'Offline' file areas (CmdType: F5)

        Moving Files           : Good for taking care of files that are
                                 in the wrong place.  Useful if you have
                                 idiots uploading. (CmdType: F7)

        Local Upload           : Add files that exist on the disk but not

     At  the heart of Dominion is the system configuration feature.  It  is
     here  that  the entire operation of the system is set up,  from  modem
     configuration to file archiving options to time allowances and  upload
     and  download  restrictions.   This section is  selected  by  the
     "O" command in WFC mode, or executing CmdType: SO.  The Configuration
     is divived into 11 sub sections.

    1. Names and Paths :       This section allows you to change the
                               directories and passwords that the system
                               uses.

    2. Flagged Information :   This sections allows you to enable and disable
                               system options, such as File Ratio, 2Way Chat
                               etc..

    3. Variable System Data :  This allows you to change values and
                               amounts.  Such as the actual PCR,
                               menu file names, etc.

    4. Event Manager :         This allows you to setup certain events for
                               the system to run at a specified time.

    5. Modem Information :     You can change your ComPort info from here.
                               To change your Result info and such, You'll
                               need to use the Dominion Modem Script Compiler,
                               which is detailed in another section.

    6. Security Profiles :     The BBS can store 10 sets of generic user data,
                               which you can automatically set the users
                               account to with Profile sets by seleting
                               a set.

    7. Archive Configuration : Use this to setup how the BBS handles

        This Section of the Configuration is used to define where the BBS
        finds its files, System Passwords, and Specific system information,
        such as Telephone numbers and SysOp name.  To edit an item, enter
        its number.


    1. System Name :           The Name of your Bulletin Board System.

    2. System Phone :          Your BBS's 10 Digit Telephone Number.

    3. System Password :       This is also known as the SysOp Password.
                               A User attempting to logon remotely with
                               a SysOp's Account (SL=255), they will be
                               prompted for this Password.  A remote user
                               attempting certain "SysOp-only" commands
                               will also be prompted for this password.

   9. Input Prompt Type : This toggles the input bar between a blue bar and
                          a bar of dots.  Try them both to see what you like
                          best (this bar will be used for most of the input
                          in the system, ie: chat reason, Title for Posts,
                          and about a zillion other things).

   0. Matrix Active :     Yes: The System will use a Matrix Menu. In order to
                          Access the System, users will need the Matrix Pass-

                          will be unavailable for chat. (These chat times will
                          override the <Scroll Lock> Key for chat availability.
                          Setting both times to 00:00:00 will make the SysOp
                          always available if <Scoll Lock> is off, and always
                          Unavailable if <Scroll Lock> is on.

                          Chat is Active (see next field).

   E. Chat Type :         This toggles the Chat Type between Regular, Rotating
                          or Filtered. Rotating Chat colors are defined in the
                          above field. The SysOp Chat Filter is Sysop.flt and
                          the user's Filter is User.flt.  You must use the
                          editor Coconfig.exe to edit these filters.

   1. Logon Event :       The Event executed when a User Logs On to the
                          System.

   2. Logoff Event :      This Event is executed each time a User Logs off
                          of the system.

   3. Begin Day Event :   This event is executed when the first caller of the
                          day logs on.

   4. New User Event :    This Event is executed when a New User logs on to
                          the System.

   5. Timed Event         This is the time (in military time) when your

                         ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

Due to the irregularities in today's high speed modems, it is impossible to
create a set of init strigns and responses that will work for every modem.
To circumvent this problem, Dominion uses a special script language for dealing
with different modems.  It is quite simple, the BBS looks for something in the
script, and responds with what the script tells it to.  Quite flexible.  You
can have up to 255 different responses.


                       ÕÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¸
                       ³High Speed Modem Primer³
                       ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

When modems first were built, the modem and the computer talked to each other
at the same speed as the modem was talking to the other modem at.  That is,
if the modem called another modem that ran at 2400 baud, then the computer
would talk to the modem at 2400 baud.  But as faster modems came out, and
compression methods were created, the modem had to send the data that would be
transfered at a much higher rate, to allow for time to compress the data.
Thats where we get speeds like 19,200, 38,400, 56,700, etc.  There is no such
thing as a modem that communicates at 19,200, or 38,400, or etc.  The fastest
available modems are either 14,400 v32bis modems, or 16,800 HST Modems (actually
the HST is not truly 16,800, but it will attempt to raise its throughput
from 14,400 to somewhere near 16,800, if phone line conditions permit).
The computer simply sends the modem the data to be sent at 19,200.  The
modem is still sending only at 14,400, and is compressing the data to
be sent at the same time. So next time someone tells you that his modem
is really fast cause its a 19200, tell him he has his head up his ass.

                            ³Fossil Driver³
                            ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

Fossil Drivers are device drivers or TSR's that handle communications from
a program to the modem, relieving the programmer of that task.  What a break


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 27


this is to us.  The word Fossil stands for 'F'IDO 'O'pus 'S'EADog 'S'tandard
'I'nterface 'L'ayer.  They were originally developed to allow non-standard
IBM style motherboards to communicate with modems by tricking things, but this
is generally no longer the case.  Fossil's provide great multitasking
communications, and that sort of thing, for programmers who have better things
to do than writting com routines (Its a waste of time).

So where does Dominion come in with all this.  Simple, Dominion REQUIRES
a Fossil Driver to actually boot up.  X00 and BNU are by far the 2 best
and popular Fossil drivers used today.  They support high speed communications
well, and are easy to use.  Refer to their documentation for specific info,
but to simply install them for quick usage, put this in your config.sys :

        device=x00.sys E
              or
        Device=Bnu.sys

A nice trick with X00 is that you can rename it to X00.exe, and run it as a
TSR, and uninstall it by running it again.

The script must contain all of the following information.
A ; at the begining of a line signifies a Comment or Remark.
Each piece of data is preceeded with a 4 letter marker, and a :, with
a | after the data.

                  as "CONNECT 19200", or "PROTOCOL: NONE", which modems
                  return while connecting.

     ACS  stands for Access Condition String, and is a powerful new  method
     of  stating  the requirements and conditions under which  a  user  has
     access to something -- whether it be a file area, or a menu command.

     The ACS system combines security levels (SL and DSL), AR and several
     other unique features into a string. This string will be used to see
     if the user should or should not have access to the file area, area,
     menu, command, etc.

     There  are 12 different functions in the ACS system, and all  of  them
     have the same basic syntax:  A letter followed by the parameter of the
     function,  all of which can be specified in upper or lower case.   The
     following is a list of all possible functions.

  ACS Command: Gn       Description: User must be at least n years old.

                        *IMPORTANT NOTE* : Divide the Baud Rate you wish
                        to use for this field by 100 (ie - for 2400 baud
                        use B24, for 14400 baud use B140, etc).

  ACS Command: C        Description: User must pass a PCR check to have
                                     access.

  ACS Command: Dnnn     Description: User's DSL must be nnn.

  ACS Command: In       Description: User must have a DAR of n.

  ACS Command: Snnn     Description: User must have an SL of nnn.

  ACS Command: Unnn     Description: Must be User Number n.

  ACS Command: V        Description: DESQview must be running.

  ACS Command: @n       Description: User's Current Conference must have
                                     n in its flag string.

  ACS Command: #        Description: SysOp Must be Available.







     The following are a few examples:

         "S50"  ş User must have SL of 50
         "#"    ş SysOp Must be available
         "AB"   ş User must have AR B

     There  are five logical operators that can be used in ACS, only  three
     of which (the first three) are used frequently:

          "&" - Logical AND
          "!" - Logical NOT

     The AND operator is easy to use. Just place an "&" charecter between
     two ACS Commands. This will cause the system to check for both ACS
     conditions. If the user lacks access to even one of the conditions, he
     will not have access to the particular command, file base, etc. For
     example: FA&C means that the user must have AR Flag A and his Post to
     Call Ratio must be in check.


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 32



     The  NOT  operator is also easy to use.  Just place  a  "!"  character
     before any function to reverse it's meaning.  For example: "!FA" means
     the  user  must NOT have AR flag "A" to have access.   IMPORTANT:   Be
     sure  to  remember  that,  in  numeric  functions,  the  NOT  operator
     COMPLETELY  REVERSES THE MEANING of the function.  Thus,  "!S30"  does
     NOT  mean "SL less than or equal to 30"; it means "SL less  than  30",
     *without* the "equal to".





     Here are some more examples:

          S50            User must have SL 50 to 255.
          !S50           User must have SL 0 to 49.
          !G21&!IA&!S50  User has access SO LONG AS they have NONE of the
                         three.



     I will also take this opportunity to explain Access Restrictions at
     this time. Access Restrictions may be set in various places througout
     the BBS (ie - User Editor, <F1> Window, etc). These do exactly what
     they say, Restrict the User's Access. Here is a list of the charector
     for each restriction, and what its function is :
          L - User may only Logon Once Per Day.
          C - User can not page the SysOp for chat.
          M - User's Posts will not be seen by other users until validated
              by a SysOp.
          A - User can not write new AutoMessages.
          * - User can not post annonymously (even if his SL allows it).
          P - User can not post messages.
          U - User can not see User List (CmdType: OU)
          E - User can not write Email.
          V - User can not vote.
          N - User can not access networked message areas.
          ! - User's Uploads all go to SysOp directory.
          R - User can not write Rumors/Oneliners.
          B - User can not add to the BBS List.
          T - User can not withdraw time from the TimeBank.

                         ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

      Dominion provides a powerful system for displaying and handling
      system and  user  information, in prompts, command lines and  text
      messages. This  is  done  using  a set of  codes  called  MCI
      (Message  Command Interpreter).  These codes are entered with the
      character "`" followed by  a specific ASCII character.  Changing
      colors in text  messages  is accomplished through a special system
      that is described later.

      If you are inside of Dominion and you wish to use an MCI code (ie -
      writing a message, etc.) you must proceed the MCI Code with a "`".

      The following is a list of the MCI Commands available from Dominion
      (remember to execute each MCI Code in the manner mentioned above):

     `` - Displays one `
     `! - Displays the System's File Ratio
     `# - Displays the User's File Ratio.
     `$ - Displays the User's Post Call Ratio
     `% - Displays the System's Post Call Ratio
     `^ - Displays File Ratio Status
     `& - Displays Post Call Ratio Status
     `* - Displays User's Number of Posts
     `( - Displays User's Number of Calls
     `( - Displays User's Number of Calls Today
     `+ - Displays the last User to call
     `A - Displays the Current Message Base number of the user online
     `B - Displays the Current Message Base of the user online
     `C - Displays the Current File Base number of the user online
     `D - Displays the Current File Base name  of the user online
     `E - Displays Users Last Logon Date
     `F - Displays the number of File Points the Current user Online has Left
     `G - Displays the Current Conference Name
     `H - Displays User's Handle WITHOUT user number
     `I - Clear's the Current User Online's Screen of all text
     `J - Displays User's Download Security Level
     `K - User's Number of Uploads in Kilobytes
     `L - Displays the Current User Online's User Number
     `M - Creates an Enter (use to continue string on next line, etc)
     `N - Displays the Current User Online's Name w/ User Number
     `O - Displays How many files the user has Downloaded

                           ³MCI Color Codes³
                           ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

     Dominion has 2 Color Systems.  The First is a set of predefined Standard
     Colors which are determined by the users account configuration.
     This method is outlined below:

     The  ability  to display any of the Twenty MCI colors in  messages,
     text files,  prompt strings, etc., is Provided Via Control
     Sequences. The first method  is usable almost everywhere in
     Dominion:  At the point  where you wish to change to another MCI
     color, press either [Ctrl-P] or [Ctrl-E] depending on the Color Set
     you Wish to use, the first 10 or the second 10. (hold down the
     [Ctrl] key and press the "P" or "E" key, then release both) and
     then press  a number key  ("0" through "9"). From then on, the
     current  MCI  color will be  the one corresponding to the number
     you pressed,  until  the color  is changed again either by the
     system or by another  MCI color code sequence.

     (Technical  note:   The color code is stored as a  two-byte  sequence,
     for the 1st set 0  (alt-3) or  (alt-14) for the second, and "0"
     through "9" ,  depending on  the number  you selected.  This is why
     you  sometimes  see  funny characters  when  you TYPE a Dominion
     .MSG file from  DOS;  more than likely, that file contains MCI
     color codes. If you wish to enter these color codes in an external
     text file, merely precede the charector(s) you wish to change the color


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 35


     of with a  or , followed by the corresponding color's number (0-9).
     These codes will be stripped for non-ANSi Users, so therefore will not
     "mess up" your file.)




     Dominion's second color method is based off of the IBM ASCII color
     set, 1-256, where 1-128 are normal colors, and 129-256 are blinking.
     To use these colors, give a Alt-5, and a Alt-Color to use.  This
     is only possible from external text files, or strings.





                            ÕÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¸
                            ³String Editor³
                            ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

     In addition to its Menu System, Dominion hightens its Morphability
     by allowing customization of MOST of it's system strings.  That is,
     the messages displayed to the user at certain moments.  Dominion
     has quite a few more strings available to change then most Morphic
     BBSes, such as Telegard (which only has about 30 or so), with over
     70 strings available to edit.  The String editor is also quite
     friendly and easy to use, but NOT NECCESARY. Dominion can read in
     and extract strings for quick editing via your favorite text
     editor.


     There are a few string editor commands, here is a summary:
             Q - Quit
             ] - Next set of 10 strings
             [ - Last set of 10 strings
             E - Extract strings to Strings.txt (more on this later)
             R - Read in from Strings.txt (Again, more later)
             1-9 - Edit string 1-9

     The String editor tells you what string is what, via a small
     description before each string. These strings are displayed throughout
     the software, and by editting them you can TOTALLY change the way the
     system looks (remeber Hex editting your old softwares to make them
     look original?, well this is a zillion times easier!). The String
     Editor can use Dominion Color Codes and Dominion MCI Codes (both
     explained elsewhere in the docs).

                      ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

     Once you (E)xtract the strings from the Dominion String editor, simply
     shell to DOS, and use a regular text editor to edit the file
     STRINGS.TXT. You can use all Dominion Color Codes and MCI Codes (refer
     to those sections for more information). This makes string editting
     significantly easier.

     When you have finished editting your STRINGS.TXT, simply return to the
     BBS, re-enter the string editor and type (R). This will (R)ead in your
     new strings.

     IMPORTANT NOTE: BE CAREFUL NOT TO SCREW UP.  DO NOT ADD ANY LINES OR
     DELETE ANY LINES FROM STRINGS.TXT WHILE IN YOUR TEXT EDITOR. The
     posistion of each string must remain constant. If you move them around
     from line to line, when they are reread in, things will be fucked to
     hell. BE CAREFUL.

                             ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

     Format Files give Dominion a great deal more Morphism than most
     other BBSes. A Format file is a small text file, a few lines long,
     that the BBS Uses to create certain screens or strings with.  Each
     format has it's own special codes, so it is important to be
     careful, and to READ THIS SECTION!!!

     Format Files can have MCI's and color Codes in them.  Each line
     though, is treated seperatly.  Here is a list of the format files
     Dominion Uses, and its codes.  The codes follow the same format,
     %1-9, each defined by the formater.

                    %4 - Software

      BOX.FMT : This format is special.  It is used to box certain system
                messages.  Since its contents are variable in length, they must
                be specially entered :

                    The 1st line of the file should contain the character
                    that will be the upper border of the box, and the
                    character to be used as the lower border of the box. The
                    rest is the actual format.

                   special.  Each line is one particular display mode.
                   The 1st line is for regular online files, the 2nd for
                   offline files, and the 3rd for unvalidated files.

     Stored in what is often called the Graphics, or Afiles directory are
     certain system files.  These files may have either of two extensions:
     .ANS or .MSG. If both exist, .ANS will be shown to ANSi Users, and
     .MSG will be shown to non-Ansi Users. If only one exists it has the
     .MSG extension. This will be shown to ALL users, and should not


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 39


     contain ANSi Codes. Color *MAY* be shown in a .MSG file through the
     use of Dominion Color Codes (or MCI Color Codes), explained earlier
     in this doc. These codes (and their corresponding colors) will be
     shown to ANSi users, but stripped for Non-ANSi Users, so you should
     not be worried about these codes "messing up" your textfiles.

     Here is a list of the System Files Dominion displays, and their function.
     NOTE: All of this files are found in the AFILES directory.
     If the File is listed as 'FILENAME.MSG/ANS' it is one of the "special"
     files described in the above paragraph.

        AUTO.MSG         The Current System AutoMessage.

        BBSLIST.MSG      The System's BBS List.

        BDAY.MSG/ANS     Displayed at Logon if it is the user's Birthday.

        COLLIST.MSG/ANS  The screen displayed in the color adjustment editor
                         to list the colors and give an example.

        COMMENT          The comment file given to Archive Comment Commandline
                         as %5.

        FEEDBACK.MSG/ANS Displayed before NewUsers send their validation
                         feedback to the SysOp on their first call.

        LASTON.TXT       This is a list of the last 8 callers of the day.

        LOCKOUT.MSG/ANS  Displayed to a locked out user at an attempted logon.

        LOGON.MSG/ANS    Displayed right after the user has succesfully
                         logged on (entered his name, password, etc).

        LOGINF.MSG/ANS   If this file is present, and Your Info in Logon is
                         enabled, then this will be displayed. If the file
                         is not present, then the Your Info (CmdType OY) is
                         executed.

        LOGOFF.MSG/ANS   Displayed by the Hangup Command Types during logout.

        MATRIX.MSG/ANS   Displayed as the Matrix Logon Menu (If not present,
                         then a default Matrix Menu will be shown.)

                         with EXTREME care, as you must not mess up its
                         positioning.

        NEWUSER.MSG/ANS  Displayed to a user who chooses to Logon as 'NEW'.
                         This is displayed before any account data is taken,
                         so it is an excellent place to let people know if

                       ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

     Dominion is capable of FidoNet style networking, through the use of
     message packers and mailers, such as FrontDoor and Squish.  Dominion
     can internally prepare its messages to be handled by Packers such as
     Squish, TossScan, or Confmail.  The Dominion Development Team suggests
     the use of Squish, as it is simple to use, and up to date with today's
     standards, as your Message Packer, and FrontDoor as your Mailer,
     for the same reasons.  This internal packing/tossing of messages
     simplfies the running of the BBS, as opposed to other systems, such as
     LSD, OPUS, RemoteAccess, etc, which require that the BBS exit and run
     a seperate utility to Toss and Scan messages, then return to the BBS.
     This requires complicated batch files which dwell much around error
     levels and sub functions.  Future versions of Dominion will also
     have the ability to control FrontDoor themselves, rather than have
     FrontDoor run, get a call, run the BBS, then return to itself.  But for
     now, the standard method will have to suffice.

                        ³FidoNet: How it Works³
                        ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

     The basic idea of FidoNet is quite simple, one BBS shares its messages
     with a variety of other BBSes.  Due to the 1000's of different BBS systems
     out there, a standard format has emerged to facilitate the simple
     trade of messages across different platforms.  This format is basically
     quite simple, straight text with a little bit of data about the message.
     G00ting your messages into this format requires a little bit of work
     though.  There is a four step (or three for systems such as Dominion
     or OPUS) path for the transmission of messages that most systems follow.

        User Posts Message on BBS

        BBS (or its Mail Scanner) converts the Post into the FidoBBS Format
                |
        An EchoMail Scanner such as Squish Converts the Post into Echomail
                Packet Format, which contains some extra stuff, and
                combines many posts into one packet for transmission.
                |
        EchoMail Mailer actually sends this packet to the other BBS, and
                recieves Packets from it.
                |
        The Echomail Tosser converts the packets into induvidual FidoBBS
                message files, and places them into their approiate
                directories (explained later)
                |
        The BBS (or it's Tosser) converts the Fido messages into its own
                format.
                |
        The User reads the messages on the BBS, and is happy.


     Not a complicated process, but a bit lenghty.  It does ultimatly
     pay off, as being the definative standard in message networking.

     Messages for each sub are scanned into EchoMail packets(or Tossed to the
     BBS) from a specific directory dedicated to EACH SINGLE MESSAGE AREA.
     IE: if you have 10 networked areas, you have 10 directories, one for each.
     The messages in each area will be scanned into files who's names are
     numbers, signifing which message they are.
     IE: the first message scanned is 1.msg, the next is 2.msg, etc.
     The same is true for messages tossed into the directory.

     Between each toss and scan, a PURGE must occur.  A Purge removes any
     existing Fido message files from the directory, so that incoming messages
     won't be mixing with outgoing messages.  Don't be confused, its a simple
     thing (Alot of people lose it around here).

                  ³Specifics on Dominion and FidoNet³
                  ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

     Dominion is a little more tightly knit in its mail directory scheme
     than most other systems.  The system will scan to and toss from a
     directory off the Messages Directory, with the same name as the Message
     Area's filename.  This gives a bit of oneness in the way it all works, and
     gives some organization to everything.

     There are two ways to Scan, Toss, and Purge messages.  The first is from


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 44


     the commandline, by running the BBS:

        Dom /AS         Scan Messages

        Dom /AT         Toss Messages

        Dom /AP         Purge Messages


      The second method is to call the Scanner, Tosser, and Packer inside
      of the BBS using the following Command Types.

        !S              Scan Messages

        !T              Toss Messages

        !P              Purge Messages


     Follow these simple rules, and read the manual to your Mailer and
     EchoMail Processor, and networking will be a snap.

     The file base editor serves a valuable purpose in that it sets up your
     file  bases, which are ESSENTIAL for the uploading and downloading  of
     files on the BBS.

     Dominion can have up to 64 file areas, across all conferences.  That
     does not mean it has 64 areas per conference, but the 64 are divided
     amongst the conferences.

     Upon  entering the file base editor, a screen similar to  the  example
     shown below will be displayed:

     The following commands are available from this screen:

          (D)elete base (I)nsert base
          (M)odify base (?)Relist Areas
          (Q)uit

     Here is an explanation of each and its usage :

   ?. ReList Areas :      Will Redisplay the File Areas (If an Area has
                          been added or deleted, it will now be shown on
                          your screen).

   D. Delete Base :       Deletes a File Area. You will be prompted for
                          the number of the base to delete (0-97). When
                          you delete a File Base, Dominion will automa-
                          tically move all the bases up one position.
                          This will not delete the files in the directory
                          but it WILL delete their descriptions, so make
                          sure this is what you want to do.

   I. Insert Base :       Inserts a new File Base. You will be prompted for
                          the file base to insert it before. Inserting this
                          File Base will move all of the bases up one place.

                          NOTE: Dominion uses "<<Not Used>>" as the default
                          description, NEWDIR as the default filename. The
                          default download path is set in the system config.







   M. Modifty Base :      Allows you to edit each individual File Area, and
                          will be discussed in detail shortly.

   Q. Quit Editor :       Will exit the file base editor and return you to
                          the board or the WFC Menu (depending upon where
                          you entered it from).


     From the screen shown above, you should (M)odify a File Base in order
     to set it up the way you desire. The Following is a sample screen of
     what you will see when choosing the Modify File Base option :

                          to have a different directory for each file
                          area).

   4. ACS :               This defines the ACS required for the User to
                          Access the File Area (The ACS System is described
                          elsewhere in the docs).

   5. Conference :        This defines the conference that the File Area
                          will be accessable from (If you enter @ then the

   6. Max Files :         The defines the Maximum amount of files the file
                          base may contain. Once this number is reached, a
                          User may not upload to this File Area, and files
                          may not be moved into it.

   7. DAR :               Defines the DAR required to access the file area.
                          Even if the user passes the ACS check, if he
                          doesn't have this DAR, he can't access the area.





   [. Last Area :         Allows you to edit the previous File Area.

   ]. Next Area :         Allows you to edit the next File Area.

   Q. Quit :              Quits back to the previous File Base Editor

                          areas. From here you may quit to the BBS or
                          WFC Menu).

   R. Ratio Checking :    Even if ratios are active in your config, if
                          given this flag, the file area will not check

   C. AutoUpload Credit : If given this flag, the User will be given
                          credit for an upload upon uploading it (even
                          if UL Credit is off) without requiring SysOp
                          validation.

     features  such as data file name, maximum number of messages,  message
     base  security  levels  for viewing and posting,  and  other  security
     features.

     Dominion currently can have upto 64 message areas, all of which can
     be FidoNetworked.  The message bases are spread out accross the
     confereces.  This is not to say that it has 64 bases per conference,
     but that the 64 are devided amongst the conferences.

                         ³The Protocol Editor³
                         ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾

     The protocol editor allows you to set up different protocols for
     transferring files. The most common protocols are Xmodem, Ymodem and
     Zmodem; they have already been set up for you in the protocol editor.
     All you need to do is place the appropriate program into any directory
     that is part of your DOS PATH statement. Dominion may have up to 255
     different protocols.

     In order for your default protocols to work you will need copies of
     DSZ and HSLink. Look for both programs on local PD boards throughout
     your area (Altho, a registered copy of DSZ is HIGHLY recommended as
     you may use certain protocols, such as Ymodem-G, without a registered
     copy. Simply extract both files to a directory contained in your path.

     Dominion's transfer system is COMPLETELY batch oriented. All
     transfering REQUIRES batch compatible protocols. The files to be sent
     will almost always be sent in using a Batch List, and the files
     recieved will be read out of the DSZLOG. This ensures perfect
     transfers everytime, with a minimum of work. Also, BiDierctional
     transfers are internaly supported, as long as the protocol writes to
     DSZLOG. HSLink is HIGHLY recommended for your BiDirectional Transfers
     as it is proven to work perfectly with Dominion. All transfers are
     recieved and processed in the BATCH directory, before being moved to
     their appropriate Download Directory, in order to keep everything
     neat.

     In certain instances, the BBS may desire to send a Single File, so
     certain protocols should be defined as a single protocol (such as
     Zmodem and Ymodem). These protocols would be available when doing
     things such as uploading files as messages, downloading file lists
     and other things. For the protocol to be active for these functions,
     you must activate Single Protocol and give it a command line (this
     process is explained in detail later in this section).

     When you enter the protocol editor, you will see a screen similar to
     the one shown below :

     Dominion's menu system is the base of the entire system's structure;


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 64


     almost every command that a user will ever enter can be modified,
     added to, and deleted from your BBS with the use of the menu editor.
     Dominion's Menu Editor is based heavily upon that of Telegard, mainly
     to give a bit of "standardness" to menu editing, but also because
     Telegard's Menu Editor is by far the best.

     The menu system is broken up into individual menu FILES, each of which
     define the different menus of your system. The menu files all exist
     in your MENUS directory, and all have the file extension of "MNU".
     One advantage of having a multiple menu-file system, over a single
     menu-file system, is that other people who write Telegard add-on
     utilities, such as online doors, can include the menu file with their
     programs, minimizing the total amount of work necessary on the SysOp's
     part.


     --------------------
     THE MAIN EDITOR MENU

     Upon  entry  to the Menu Editor, you will be presented with  a  screen

     Parameter are all displayed (found in that order).

     The following are descriptions of the commands available here:

   ?. Help :               Displays a list of the commands available.

   Q. Quit :               Exits to the previous Screen of the Menu Editor
                           (the one that displayed all the menu files) and
                           from there you may return to the BBS or WFC
                           Menu.

                           perminently removed from the menu.

   V. View Menu :          This will show how the menu will actually look
                           to the users.

   X. Toggle Display Mode :There are two types of Menu data that may be
                           edited, this takes you to the second screen
                           (the menu information editor). This will be
                           explained in further detail later in this
                           section.

   M. Modify Commands :    You will be prompted for the number of the
                           command you wish to edit. This will allow you
                           to edit that commands information, and is
                           explained in detail below.

     -------------------------
     MENU COMMAND MODIFICATION
     -------------------------

     When you choose to (M)odify a Command, you will be prompted for the
     number of the command you wish to modify, when choosing this, you

     ______________________________________________________________________

     This is probably starting to get confusing right about now! If you
     ARE getting confused, don't worry; you'll understand it soon enough,
     after a little usage. From here, the following modification and
     movement commands are available:

   1. Description :        Allows you to change the description of the
                           the command, this is what the user will see
                           when he displays the menu.


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 67



   2. Key :                This defines the key used to activate the
                           command. You may precede the command with a
                           '/', in which case, the system will await a
                           second charector to be entered (this is useful
                           if you want two commands with a similar key. IE
                           - <A>rea List and </A>rchive Menu in the File
                           Menu). The command activation key may be up to
                           eight charecters long. If a user with hot keys
                           active wishes to use one of these commands, he
                           must precede it with '//', which will allow the
                           entering of an "Extended" Command.

   3. Type :               This is the two charector Command Type string
                           This string tells the system what the command
                           should do. A list of ALL possible Command Types
                           may be found in the file MENUS.DOC. (NOTE: A
                           user will SysOp access may execute any command
                           type, even if the current menu does not have a
                           command to execute the Command Type. The SysOp
                           simply needs to enter in the "Any CmdType"
                           String <defineable in the string editor>. This
                           two charector string is ** in your default
                           Dominion Configuration, but may be changed to
                           whatever you please to add to system security.


   4. Attribute :          This is a special "flag" that may be assigned to
                           a command. There are 5 different attributes that
                           a command may have: (H)idden - If given this
                           attribute, the command will not be displayed on
                           the menu, even if the user has access to it.
                           (F)orced - If given this flag, the command will
                           automatically be executed upon entering the menu.
                           (U)nhidden - If given this flag, the command will
                           be displayed to ALL users (even if they do not
                           have access to it). (D)efault - If given this
                           flag, whenever the user presses [CR] in the menu,
                           this command will be executed. (T)itle - If given
                           this flag, the Command will not execute anything,
                           but rather serve as a header to seperate commands
                           from one another inside of the menu (see the
                           default File Menu's "SysOp Commands" Header).

   5. Security :           This defines the ACS required for a user to
                           execute the command. You may use any of the


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 68


                           different ACS Strings, explained in the ACS
                           System section of the docs.

   6. Line :               When the user executes the command, this string
                           will be displayed on the Command Line. It
                           normally just tells the user what the command
                           they executed is doing. It is only cosmetic,
                           and is not essential to the execution of the
                           command.

   7. Parameter :          This is used in conjunction with the Command
                           Command Types, it allows one command type to
                           perform a variety of different actions. All of
                           the Command Type Parameters may be found in the
                           file MENUS.DOC.

   Q. Quit :               This will return you to the previous screen of
                           the menu editor (where all of the menus
                           commands are displayed).


     -----------------------
     MENU INFORMATION EDITOR
     -----------------------

     I will be careful not to lose you at this part. After you (Q)uit from
     the screen displayed above (the menu command modification screen),
     you will return to the previous screen (the screen that showed ALL of
     the commands available in the menu, along with their command type,
     parameter and attribute). From this screen (the one that shows ALL of
     the commands available for the menu), if you press (X) a screen
     similar to the following will be displayed :
     ______________________________________________________________________

     Menu File Name: MAIN

     1. Prompt       : (`Z)`M[`T Left] (Main Menu) [?/Menu] :
     2. Titles       : Dominion Bulletin Board System
                     : Main Menu
     3. Ansi Menu    :

     5. Change Style : 5,4,3 - 4 Columns
     6. 3D Effects   : Yes

     Menu Editor (?=Help):
     ______________________________________________________________________


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 69



     The following commands are available from this menu:

   1. Prompt :             This allows you to change the Menu Prompt. This
                           Prompt may include any of the system's MCI
                           Codes (explained in a different section of the
                           docs).

   2. Titles :             This allows you to change the two line header
                           that is displayed at the top of the menu. It
                           makes sense for one of these lines to contain
                           the name of the menu.

   3. ANSI Menu            This defines the filename of an external file
                           you wish to display in place of the menu
                           (obviously, it should simply be an external
                           file that displays the commands available from
                           the menu). This/these ANSI menus should be found
                           in your AFILES directory. If it has an
                           extension of .ANS it will be displayed to ANSI
                           users, if it has an extension of .MSG, it will
                           be displayed to non-ANSI users. If either of
                           these files does not exist, the internal menu
                           will be shown. (NOTE: When entering in the
                           filename in the menu editor, you should not
                           include a description. The system will
                           automatically look for the files FILENAME.ANS
                           and FILENAME.MSG in the AFILES directory).

   4. Security :           This defines the ACS requirement that the user
                           must satisfy in order to access the menu. This
                           may use any of the ACS Strings found in the ACS
                           System section of the docs. If the user does
                           not meet the ACS requirement, then the system
                           will tell him that he does not meet the ACS
                           requirement, and he will be returned to the
                           previous menu.

   5. Change Style :       This allows you to change the style of your menu.
                           When you choose this option, a screen resembling
                           the following will be displayed :

                         Menu Style Editor

                         1. Brackets    : 5
                         2. Commands    : 4


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 70


                         3. Description : 3
                         4. Columns     : 4
                         5. Border Char : Ä
                         6. Border Attr : 5

                         Select:

                           When you enter in the Description for a new
                           command, Dominion breaks that description up
                           into 3 parts: the brackets, command, and the
                           description. The brackets are the ()'s or []'s
                           or ®¯'s or <>'s or whatever else you have choosen
                           to seperate the command letter from the rest of
                           the description. Choice 1 is the color that you
                           wish to make those brackets (You must enter a
                           number in this field, it will display the number's
                           corresponding color, as defined by the system or
                           user, extended colors are entered as 10-19). The
                           Command is the key you have choosen to execute
                           the Command. Choice 2 is the color that you wish
                           to display the key to execute the command in, this
                           again wants you to input a number to correspond
                           with the desired color. The description is every-
                           thing that comes after the trailing bracket, and
                           should describe what the command does. Enter the
                           number of the color you wish the menu's descriptions
                           to be displayed in. The Fourth option changes the
                           number of columns you want the menu displayed in.
                           Dominion will auotmatically distribute the commands
                           throughout the columns. The 5th option is only for
                           3D Menus, this is the charecter that will form
                           lines above and below the menu. Option 6 is the
                           color's number you wish that charector to be.
                           To make sure you understand the coloring scheme,
                           in default Dominion, this setup would make all
                           brackets appear blue, the letter of the command
                           would be yellow, and the description of the
                           command would be Cyan. The border char (for 3D
                           menus) would be blue.

   6. 3D Effects :         Pressing 6 will toggle 3D effects on and off. If
                           3D effects are active, then the command letters
                           will be displayed on a grey bar that gives the
                           menu a 3-Dimensional look. (NOTE: If 3D effects
                           are on, then the menu will not display the menu
                           colors defined in the above field.

                           hassle of exiting and entering the menu everytime
                           you wish to see how a change you have made will

     There are several internal commands that may be used from ANY menu on

                           for a user in expert or regular mode, but makes
                           little sense for someone that is in Idiot Mode.

      There are many possibilities to the "effects" you can cause by using
      Dominion's Morphic Menu System. A small list of these possibilities
      is shown below, but they are endless :


     ù Dominion Bulletin Board System Version 3.0 Standard ù Page 73



        Linking: When you call a command, the BBS will look through the ENTIRE
                 menu for commands with the Key used.  It will then execute
                 ALL commands with the same key (as long as the user has access
                 to them).
                 For Example:
                     To do a NewScan of BOTH the File Areas and the Message
                     Bases, Link the FN (File NewScan) and MN (Message NewScan)
                     commands together. This is achieved by giving both
                     commands the same key, and placing them in the same menu
                     (obviously, it would make sense to give one of the
                     commands a Hidden Attribute, so that the menu doesn't
                     display the same command twice.

        Forcing: ALOT is possible with Forced Command Items.
                 For Example:
                        To Simulate LSD's Transfer Area Entrance Routine:

                        At the Top of your File.Mnu:
                        Have 3 commands, one of type OF (Display File), with
                        an Parameter of File.  The BBS will display
                        File.ans or File.msg (ANSI/Non-ANSI).
                        Make the second command, CmdType OF and parameter
                        rules, and make the files rules.ans/msg.
                        Have a third, of Type FN (File Area NewScan), with
                        a Parameter of G? (Global Maybe), which will ask
                        if the user wants to Newscan all areas.
                        Give all commands Attributes of 'F'orced.
                        Now when the user enters the File Menu, the system
                        will display file.ans/msg (File Stats), then display
                        rules.ans/msg (file area rules), then ask the user
                        if he wants to NewScan the File Areas.

        Defaults: You can create Y/N question prompts with these.
                For Example:
                         If you want to make a prompt ask you if you wish to
                         newscan the message area when you enter the message
                         menu, make a menu file with 3 commands in it. The
                         first command should be CmdType MN, the second
                         should be CmdType =^ (with a param of message.mnu).
                         The third command should be CmdType =^ (with a param
                         of message.mnu). Make the prompt look somthing like
                         this: 'Would you like to NewScan Messages? [Y/N] '.
                         Make the key for the first *2* commands 'Y' (using
                         the command linking that we discussed earlier) and
                         make the third command have a key of 'N'.

      Many many more things are possible.  Its basically piecing the
      Command Types together for it to do whatever you want.  OL (Print
      Line) and OF (Print File) are VERY useful, if used correctly.

     Dominion's Mailing List Function is quite useful. If a file with an
     extension of .MML, in your AFILES directory, then it may be used as
     a mailing list.  In this file, you should enter the name or number
     of several users (one on each line). When you use the mailing list
     command (@ from the WFC Menu, or Command Type MA) you will be prompted
     for the filename (without extension) of the mailing list to use. Each
     user whose name or user number is contained in this mailing list will
     receive the Email that you write.

     The  InfoForm system is one of Dominion's most powerful
     information-gathering   features.   Using  just  a  few commands
     -- scattered in an ordinary text file -- the SysOp can gather
     volumes  of information  about  users:  Who they are, what they
     want,  what  they DON'T  want.   The  uses for the  InfoForm
     system  are virtually endless.

     InfoForms are really nothing more than plain text files with
     an input command, meaningful only to the InfoForm system,  placed
     throughout.

     The InfoForm is stored in the AFILES directory,  in  a file  with
     the extension ".INF".  When users  answer  the  questions, their
     answers are also stored in the AFILES directory, in a file  with
     the  same  name as the InfoForm  but with  the  extension ".SER"
     (for "anSwERs").  Answers from different users are appended  to the
     end of the *.SER file; thus, you have a complete record  of  each
     user's responses (until you delete the *.SER file). NOTE: The size
     of your .SER files will grow to be QUITE large after a period of time.
     For this reason, it is suggested that you delete it periodically <or,
     since the .SER file is pure text, you may want to zip it up before
     deleting it. It will shrink ALOT and you can keep a perminent record
     of your user's responses, while saving disk space>).

     Constructing  a command to ask an InfoForm  is  simply  a matter
     of  adding a new command to a menu.  The  command  should  use
     CmdType "OR", with the InfoForm  filename in the  MString field.
     For example:

        1. Desc     : <Q>uestionnaire
        2. Key      : Q

        5. Security : s20
        6. Line     : Ask some questions!
        7. Parameter: infoform

     Reading an InfoForm answer file is just as easy.  Construct a  command
     using  CmdType "OG", with the InfoForm  filename  in  the
     MString field:

        1. Desc     : <R>ead Answers
        2. Key      : R

     Making a Dominion Infoform is extremely simple. All you have to do
     is make a text file that contains questions in it, then place an '*'
     wherever you want the system to prompt the user for input. No questions
     may be left blank, and the user must enter SOMTHING for every *.

     Below  is listed a small InfoForm questionnaire as an example of
     what the InfoForm system can do.  This questionnaire is suitable
     for use as a new user questionnaire (NEWUSER.INF); with a little

          Okay... just one more series of questions to answer, and then
          you'll be on your way!  It is essential for validation purposes
          and security measures that you answer the following questions
          as completely and accurately as possible.  There are no trick
          questions, so don't worry... it's not a test!

          About how long have you been BBSing? *
          Are you a SysOp of any BBS? (Y/N) : *
          If Yes, what is the Name/Number of your BBS? : *


          Do you know any of the current users on this BBS, or any other
          good users that could recommend you?  (2 lines)

           1: *
           2: *

          Well, that completes our little survey.  Hope it wasn't too
          painful!
     _____________________________________________________________________

     And thats all there is to creating a Dominion Infoform. It is very
     simple now, but there are plans for modifications to this sytem for
     future versions. As for now, this should be sufficient enough to get
     what you need to know out of your users.
